This part uses two 2-link arms, one called arm_teacher (blue) and the other called arm_student (red), as shown in the image below. For each test, a torque will be applied to the first joint of both arms for 5 seconds. arm_teacher is moving according to the provided ground truth forward dynamics and your job is to use deep learning to train the arm_student to learn the forward dynamics of arm_teacher so that it can imitate its behavior. The forward dynamics is a function that takes in the current state of an action applied to the arm, and then computes the new state of the arm. This part uses a time step of 0.01 second, meaning each time we advance the simulation, we compute the forward dynamics for 0.01 second. In the example image, the student arm is not updating its state and remains static but we will make it move after training is done.\n",

You need to think about how to do it properly so that your trained model will pass the tests successfully. It is in general very hard to learn the ground truth forward dynamics completely (that works for any distribution of actions), and during testing small errors can accumulate, leading to drastic failure in the end. You might want to try overfitting on the test cases to begin with.\n",
        "2. Make sure that your dataset for part 2 is less than 100 Mb, which is pretty much sufficient for achieving full marks. Collecting datasets can be time-consuming and you could parallelize this process for some speed-up using [ray](https://www.ray.io/). Make sure your data collection in part 2 takes <= 25 mins.\n",
