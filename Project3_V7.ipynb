This part uses two 2-link arms, one called arm_teacher (blue) and the other called arm_student (red), as shown in the image below. For each test, a torque will be applied to the first joint of both arms for 5 seconds. arm_teacher is moving according to the provided ground truth forward dynamics and your job is to use deep learning to train the arm_student to learn the forward dynamics of arm_teacher so that it can imitate its behavior. The forward dynamics is a function that takes in the current state of an action applied to the arm, and then computes the new state of the arm. This part uses a time step of 0.01 second, meaning each time we advance the simulation, we compute the forward dynamics for 0.01 second. In the example image, the student arm is not updating its state and remains static but we will make it move after training is done.\n",

You might want to try overfitting on the test cases to begin with.\n",

        "5. As mentioned in the lecture, a constant torque with pseudo gradients seems to work well for this project. You can also use multiple delta values to gather more trajectories to choose from.\n",
        "6. Since we are passing the MPC object to the controller you can instantiate the MPC class with different parameters like the planning horizon, delta values etc.\n",
        "7. To speed up data collection, avoid using np.concatenate(), np.stack() or np.append() like functions on your X and Y arrays. Instead, initialize X and Y arrays with all zeros using the correct shape and then fill in the values one by one. This is much faster in numpy. Using Ray is optional\n",
        "8. You may reuse your part 2 model for part 3, but it may be beneficial to re-collect data to train a model specific to part 3.\n",

        "- NO GPU: No GPU is required or allowed for this assignment and we will test your code without GPUs.\n",
        "- Loss Function: This is essentially a regression problem so think about what losses are suitable for regression.\n",
        "- Optimizer: While it is possible to use a simple optimizer to achieve the desired accuracy, the training time can be quite high. There exists a number of optimizers implemented in PyTorch that have much faster convergence.\n",
        "- Seeding. Please use seeding in your code to make sure your results are reproducible."
